 abstract = {© Springer International Publishing AG 2018. We present a new hybrid model-based algorithm called Memetic Path Relinking (MemPR). MemPR incorporates ideas of memetic, evolutionary, model-based algorithms and path relinking. It uses different operators that compete to fill a small population of high quality solutions. We present a new hard grouping problem derived from a real world transport lot building problem. In order to better understand the algorithm as well as the problem we analyse the impact of the different operators on solution quality and which operators perform best at which stage of optimisation. Finally we compare MemPR to other state-of-the-art algorithms and find that MemPR outperforms them on real-world problem instances.},
