 abstract = {Unlike for other problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, no widely accepted encodings for the vehicle routing problem have been developed yet. In this work, we examine different encodings and operations for vehicle routing problems. We show, how different encodings can be combined in one algorithm run and compare the individual encodings in terms of runtime and solution quality. Based on those results, we perform extensive test cases on different benchmark instances and show how the combination of different encodings and operations can be beneficial and provide a balance between solution quality and runtime.
