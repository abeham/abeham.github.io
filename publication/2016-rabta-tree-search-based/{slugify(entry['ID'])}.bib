 abstract = {We present a real world steel stacking problem featuring non instantaneous crane movements, continuous production and retrieval and stacking constraints based on the dimensions as well as temperature of the slabs. An exact Branch & Bound solver as well as three tree-search based heuristics is developed. Random benchmark instance s derived from the real world problem are used to evaluate the performance of the heuristic solvers and compare them to the exact solver.},
