 abstract = {This article presents new methods for the block relocation problem (BRP). Although much of the existing work focuses on the restricted BRP, we tackle the unrestricted BRP, which yields more opportunities for optimisation. Our contributions include fast heuristics able to tackle very large instances within seconds, fast metaheuristics that provide very competitive performance on benchmark data sets, as well as a new lower bound that generalises existing ones. We embed it in a branch-and-bound algorithm, then assess the influence of various factors on the efficiency of branch-and-bound algorithms for the BRP.},
