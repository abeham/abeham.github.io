 abstract = {In the last few years, fitness landscape analysis has seen an increase in interest due to the availability of large problem collections and research groups focusing on the development of a wide array of different optimization algorithms for diverse tasks. Instead of being able to rely on a single trusted method that is tuned and tweaked to the application more and more, new problems are investigated, where little or no experience has been collected. In an attempt to provide a more general criterion for algorithm and parameter selection other than "it works better than something else we tried", sophisticated problem analysis and classification schemes are employed. In this work, we combine several of these analysis methods and evaluate the suitability of fitness landscape analysis for the task of algorithm selection. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag.},
