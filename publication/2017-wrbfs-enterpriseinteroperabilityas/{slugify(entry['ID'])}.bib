 abstract = {© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. In this paper we are identifying enterprise interoperability as a possible framework for knowledge management in projects. In particular we are reflecting on research projects, involving small groups of companies and research institutions with heterogeneous backgrounds. The nature of research raises several issues due to the heterogeneous expertise of the project teams. This is in particular true when multiple (semi-formal) models are developed in parallel. In addition to the work evolving over time at the partner's locations, the organisational contexts moved over time, often invisible to the rest of the teams. Interoperability barriers emerge between organisations and models. Enterprise Interoperability can be used to prepare the project teams, supporting the required work on interfaces between models.},
