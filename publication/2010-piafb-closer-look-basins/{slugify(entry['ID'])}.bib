 abstract = {Formal fitness landscape analysis enables us to study basins of attraction with great detail. This seemingly simple concept shows more variability and influence on heuristic algorithms than might be expected. We have taken a new perspective and a closer look at the properties of basins of attraction using two-dimensional visualizations to arrive at a conceptually simple but heuristically challenging test function that exhibits "misleading" basins of attraction.},
