 abstract = {In recent years, software systems for the simulation of medical ultrasound imaging have been developed, thus making it possible to partially prototype transducers in software. In this paper a set of ultrasound transducer parameters is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). The settings are evaluated by simulating a B-mode scan for each transducer configuration. The quality of the generated B-Mode images is assessed by an image quality metric.},
