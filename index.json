With this approach, required flexibility in terms of fast changing data within the advancement of industry 4.0 is addressed.

Evolutionary algorithms are generic and flexible optimization algorithms which can be applied to many optimization problems in different domains. Depending on the specific type of evolutionary algorithm, they offer several parameters such as population size, mutation probability, crossover and mutation operators, or number of elite solutions. How these parameters are set has a crucial impact on the algorithm's search behavior and thus affects its performance. Therefore, parameter tuning is an important and challenging task in each application of evolutionary algorithms in order to retrieve satisfying results. In this paper, we show how software frameworks for evolutionary algorithms can support this task. As an example of such a framework, we describe how HeuristicLab enables automated execution of extensive parameter tests as well as its capabilities to analyze and visualize the obtained results. We also introduce a new chart of HeuristicLab, which can be used to compare the performance of many different parameter configurations and to drill down on different configurations in an interactive way. By this means this new chart helps users to visualize the influence of different parameter values as well as their interdependencies and is therefore a powerful feature in order to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of evolutionary algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis and Visualization of the Impact of Different Parameter Configurations on the Behavior of Evolutionary Algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Orchestration is used to guide the algorithms that solve the respective subproblems.

Due to the current structural economic transformation towards smart production and logistics, a holistic and interactive connection between involved agents and departments becomes essential. Therefore, also in the field of operations research, an innovative approach of performance measurement is necessary to ensure increasing efficiency in smart enterprises. However, using traditional mathematical optimization methods, the isolated consideration of problem models can lead to high opportunity costs in other departments. In this paper, an integrated approach for measuring the performance of combined logistics optimization problems is presented. The connection of single problems is shown by proposing optimization networks (ON), where isolated problems are solved simultaneously to be able to use synergy effects.

Compared to classical inventory management approaches, this strategy offers various degrees of freedom for the vendor while providing a certain service quality level for the customers. To capture the characteristics of rich real-world scenarios, our problem formulation consists of multiple customers, many products and stochastic product usages. Additionally, we also consider mixed formulations, where only a certain part of the customers is switched to a vendor managed inventory to allow a stepwise transition. We show that resupply and routing policies can be evolved autonomously for those scenarios using a simulation-based optimization approach. By combining inventory management and routing, the resulting policies aim to minimize costs and to maximize resource usage while maintaining a given service level. In order to validate our approach, we perform case studies and apply the evolved rules on a large-scale vendor managed inventory scenario for supermarkets. Furthermore, we show that our methodology can be used to perform a sensitivity analysis by considering the influence of exogenous and endogenous factors on the decision process, if a customer base should be transitioned to a vendor managed inventory. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","tags":null,"title":"Simulation-based evolution of resupply and routing policies in rich vendor-managed inventory scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The future application of these methods to metaheuristics can yield advanced self-adaptive metaheuristics and knowledge bases that can take the role of expert systems in the field of optimization.

Estimating whether a certain algorithm is able to tackle the problem adequately or not is a valuable piece of information that currently only an experienced human expert can give. The ability to generate such an advice automatically is, therefore, an important milestone. While fitness landscape analysis methods have been developed for exactly this purpose, it has been shown in the past that single-value analyses have limited applicability. Here, a general method for extracting fitness landscape features will be shown in combination with regression models that indicate a strong correlation between the actual and the predicted effort. Significant potential to increase the prediction quality arises when combining several measures each derived from several different sampling trajectories.

We hypothesize that by introducing the semantic similarity constraint, the fitness landscape for tabu search becomes smoother as each move can only change the fitness of the solution slightly.

In the initial definition of offspring selection stated by Affenzeller et al., offspring selection is applied to each solution after its creation using crossover and optional mutation. Thereby a solution is immediately accepted for the next generation only if it is able to outperform its parental solutions in terms of quality. It has been shown in several publications by Affenzeller et al. that this additional selection step leads to a better maintenance of high quality alleles and therefore to a better convergence behavior and a superior final solution quality. Due to the application of offspring selection after crossover and mutation, both operations become directed by the quality of the created solutions. This is in fact a different interpretation of mutation compared to classical genetic algorithms where mutation is used in an undirected way to introduce new genetic information into the search process. In this contribution the authors propose a new version of offspring selection by applying it after crossover, but before mutation. In a series of experiments the similarities and differences of these two approaches are shown and the interplay between mutation and offspring selection is analyzed.","tags":null,"title":"Mutation Effects in Genetic Algorithms with Offspring Selection Applied to Combinatorial Optimization Problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

The discussed algorithmic enhancements to a standard genetic algorithm are motivated by Holland's schema theory and the according building block hypothesis. The discussed offspring selection and the relevant alleles preserving genetic algorithm certify the survival of essential genetic information by supporting the survival of relevant alleles rather than the survival of above average chromosomes. This is achieved by defining the survival probability of a new child chromosome depending on the child's fitness in comparison to the fitness values of its own parents. By this means the survival and expansion of essential building block information information is supported also for problem representations and algorithmic settings which do not fulfill the theoretical requirements of the schema theory. The properties of these GA variants are analyzed empirically. The selected analysis method assumes the knowledge of the unique globally optimal solution and is therefore restricted to rather theoretical considerations. The main aim of this chapter is to motivate and discuss the most important properties of the discussed algorithm variants in a rather intuitive way.

In practice, however, this information changes regularly and the plan has to be adapted. This often means a complete rescheduling of all operations. We present a new approach to this problem by optimizing priority rules that can sort the available next actions. These priority rules often yield similar results even though they do not resemble each other. By using genetic programming to build these priority rules, a distributed system to compute the simulations and a solution archive with a cache of hundreds of thousands of priority rules, new insights into priority rule-based optimization are gained. This archive does not only speed up calculation by avoiding re-simulation of the same rule but can provide a pseudo Pareto front of shorter sub-optimal solutions that facilitate interpretation of the more complex rules and their evolution during the optimization process. © 2011 IEEE.","tags":null,"title":"Production Fine Planning Using a Solution Archive of Priority Rules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Operation managers typically do a good job of filling their warehouse but initially assigned storage locations might become sub-optimal over time, due to seasonal fluctuations in demand, short product life cycles or high inventory levels. Fragmented storage is a particular issue in order picking environments, where the optimal storage location of a product is not only dependent on its turn-over rate but also on the storage locations of items that frequently occur in the same picking job. In practice, operations managers are forced to periodically reorganize the warehouse to keep it operating efficiently. This process is generally done manually without any decision-support tool. In this paper we introduce an optimization approach that automatically reorganized item locations.

A lot of progress towards a theoretic description of genetic programming in form of schema theorems has been made, but the internal dynamics and success factors of genetic programming are still not fully understood. In particular, the effects of different crossover operators in combination with offspring selection are largely unknown. This contribution sheds light on the ability of well-known GP crossover operators to create better offspring when applied to benchmark problems. We conclude that standard (sub-tree swapping) crossover is a good default choice in combination with offspring selection, and that GP with offspring selection and random selection of crossover operators can improve the performance of the algorithm in terms of best solution quality when no solution size constraints are applied. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","tags":null,"title":"On the success rate of crossover operators for genetic programming with offspring selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Our proposal adapts the well-known scatter search template for single-objective optimization to the multiobjective domain. The result is a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called Archive-Based hYbrid Scatter Search (AbYSS), which follows the scatter search structure but uses mutation and crossover operators from evolutionary algorithms. AbYSS incorporates typical concepts from the multiobjective field, such as Pareto dominance, density estimation, and an external archive to store the nondominated solutions. We evaluate AbYSS with a standard benchmark including both unconstrained and constrained problems, and it is compared with two state-of-the-art multiobjective optimizers, NSGA-II and SPEA2. The results obtained indicate that, according to the benchmark and parameter settings used, AbYSS outperforms the other two algorithms as regards the diversity of the solutions, and it obtains very competitive results according to the convergence to the true Pareto fronts and the hypervolume metric. © 2008 IEEE.","tags":null,"title":"AbYSS: Adapting scatter search to multiobjective optimization.

To overcome these difficulties the authors present a generic algorithm model not only capable of representing heuristic optimization but that can be used for modeling arbitrary algorithms. This model can be used as a meta-model for heuristic optimization algorithms, enabling users to represent custom algorithms in a flexible way by still providing a broad spectrum of reusable algorithm building blocks.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling of heuristic optimization algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.
