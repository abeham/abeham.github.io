 abstract = {Optimization of simulation parameters is an important task in many different sciences where simulation is used to model and analyze complex processes and behaviors. In this work it is shown how users, such as researchers, students, and practitioners can benefit from the integration of data-exchangeinterfaces in optimization software system. The development of such an interface enables users to couple their own systems and use preimplemented algorithms for their application. The interface description is based on a unified protocol buffer approach which can be ported to further frameworks and optimization software systems. The benefits of a modular architecture, such as in the HeuristicLab optimization environment, will be examined under the light of a successful integration. HeuristicLab is available on the web under the GPL license, its application to the optimization of planning and control systems in manufacturing environments will be shown as a case study in this work. The concrete subject of the case study is a production scenario where different control strategies are used to plan different products. The question is whether machines should be dedicated to a certain control strategy or whether the machines should be shared. The quality is measured by the achieved service level and amounted inventory costs. Copyright 2012 ACM.},
