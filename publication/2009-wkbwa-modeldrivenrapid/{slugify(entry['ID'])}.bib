 abstract = {In this paper the authors describe a model driven approach for the development of heuristic optimization algorithms. Based on a generic algorithm model, several operators are presented which can be used as algorithm building blocks. In combination with a graphical user interface, this approach provides an interactive and declarative way of engineering complex optimization heuristics. By this means, it also enables users with little programming experience to develop, tune, test, and analyze heuristic optimization techniques. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
