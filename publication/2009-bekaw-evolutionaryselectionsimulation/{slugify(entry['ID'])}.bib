 abstract = {In this work we examine the effect of elitist and non-elitist selection on a supply chain problem. The problem is characterized by an output constraint which in turn separates the search space in a feasible and a non-feasible region. Additionally the simulation output is noisy due to a stochastic demand model. We will show analyze which strategy is able to perform a walk on the boundary between the feasible and infeasible space. Additionally a new selection scheme is introduced based on a statistical test to evaluate the difference between two solutions given a number of noisy quality values. This selection scheme is described and evaluated on the problem situation. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
