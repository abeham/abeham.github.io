 abstract = {In this work a simulation-based approach to the vehicle routing problem is presented. The simulation system is used to examine different problem environments and to optimize scenarios based on a generic domain model. Using the simulation environment, a concrete practical transport logistic problem scenario is modeled and the simulation is coupled to the HeuristicLab optimization framework.},
