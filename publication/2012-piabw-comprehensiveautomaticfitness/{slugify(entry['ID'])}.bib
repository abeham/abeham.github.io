 abstract = {Many different techniques have been developed for fitness landscape analysis. We present a consolidated and uniform implementation inside the heuristic optimization platform HeuristicLab. On top of these analysis methods a new approach to empirical measurement of isotropy is presented that can be used to extend existing methods. Results are shown using the existing implementation within HeuristicLab 3.3. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag.},
