 abstract = {Introduction: Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are general optimization strategies suited to solve a range of real-world relevant optimization problems. Many metaheuristics expose parameters that allow to tune the effort that these algorithms are allowed to make and also the strategy and search behavior [1]. Adjusting these parameters allows to increase the algorithms' performances with respect to different problem- and problem instance characteristics. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
