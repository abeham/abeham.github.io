 abstract = {This paper exemplarily points out how essential genetic information evolves during the runs of certain selected GA-variants. The discussed algorithmic enhancements to a standard genetic algorithm certify the survival of essential genetic information by supporting the survival of relevant alleles rather than the survival of above average chromosomes. This is achieved by defining the survival probability of a new child chromosome depending on the child's fitness in comparison to the fitness values of its own parents. The described kind of analysis assumes the knowledge of the unique global optimal solution and is therefore restricted to rather theoretical considerations The main aim of this paper is to explain the most important properties of the discussed algorithm variants in a rather intuitive way. Aspects for meaningful and practically more relevant generalizations as well as more sophisticated experimental analyses are indicated. Â© 2010 IEEE.},
