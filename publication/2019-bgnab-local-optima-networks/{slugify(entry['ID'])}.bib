 abstract = {© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019. In the era of commonly available problem-solving tools for, it is especially important to choose the best available method. We use local optima network analysis and machine learning to select appropriate algorithms on the instance-to-instance basis. The preliminary results show that such method can be successfully applied for sufficiently distinct instances and algorithms.},
