 abstract = {Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. In the optimization of real-world activities the effects of solutions on related activities need to be considered. The use of isolated problem models that do not adequately consider related processes does not allow addressing system-wide consequences. However, sometimes the complexity of the real-world model and its interplay with related activities can be described by a combination of simple, existing, problems. In this work we aim to discuss strategies to combine existing algorithms for simple problems in order to solve a more complex master problem. New challenges arise in such an integrated optimization approach.},
