 abstract = {Â© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Due to the current structural economic transformation towards smart production and logistics, a holistic and interactive connection between involved agents and departments becomes essential. Therefore, also in the field of operations research, an innovative approach of performance measurement is necessary to ensure increasing efficiency in smart enterprises. However, using traditional mathematical optimization methods, the isolated consideration of problem models can lead to high opportunity costs in other departments. In this paper, an integrated approach for measuring the performance of combined logistics optimization problems is presented. The connection of single problems is shown by proposing optimization networks (ON), where isolated problems are solved simultaneously to be able to use synergy effects. A methodology for measuring the results of an ON, called integrated performance measurement system (IPMS), is introduced. It monitors quantitative business goal achievement and ensures an overall increasing efficiency.},
