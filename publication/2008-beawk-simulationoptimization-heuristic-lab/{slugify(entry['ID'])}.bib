 abstract = {Simulation optimization today is an important branch in the field of heuristic optimization problems. Several simulators include built-in optimization and several companies have emerged that offer optimization strategies for different simulators. Often the optimization strategy is a secret and only sparse information is known about its inner workings. In this paper we want to demonstrate how the general and open optimization environment HeuristicLab in its latest version can be used to optimize simulation models.},
