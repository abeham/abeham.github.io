 abstract = {In this paper we describe the optimization of a facility layout scenario, which involves coupling simulation with the optimization environment HeuristicLab. For this purpose we show a problem formulation that acts as an interface between these two domains of problem modeling and optimization, and discuss optimization methodologies and their results for a number of artificial test problems as well as more complex real-world problems. HeuristicLab was designed with both practitioners and algorithm developers in mind. Practitioners benefit from a graphical user interface that facilitates so-called interactive algorithm engineering, where algorithms can be adjusted without actually writing code. Algorithm developers are aided in the development process by the plug-in based, easily extensible architecture and integrated parallelization functionality.},
