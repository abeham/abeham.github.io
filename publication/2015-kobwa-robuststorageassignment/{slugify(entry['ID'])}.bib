 abstract = {Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015 In many warehouses manual order picking is one of the most time and labour intensive processes. Products that are often ordered together are said to be correlated or affine and order picking performance may be improved by placing correlated products close to each other. In industries with strong seasonality patterns and fluctuating demand regular re-locations of productsmight be necessary to ensure that the quality of the storage assignment does not deteriorate over time. In this chapter we study how to generate more robust assignments that are suitable for volatile warehouse scenarios with correlated demand. In a case study based on 13 monthly snapshots from a real-worldwarehouse robust slotting outperformed greedy re-locations by up to 9.6%.},
