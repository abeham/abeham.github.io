 abstract = {Steel slabs are intermediates in the production of sheets, plates or coils in the steel industry. In this paper we consider cold charge slabs which are stored in stacks on a slab yard for a couple of hours, days or weeks until they are assigned to a rolling schedule and retrieved. When a slab is not positioned on top of a stack, retrieval requires the movement, also called shuffling, of all slabs above. We introduce a new model formulation, suitable neighbourhood and perturbation operators and discuss strategies for optimizing slab yard assignments with respect to shuffles and travel distance in picking.
