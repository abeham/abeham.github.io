 abstract = {The vehicle routing problem is a class of problems that frequently occurs in the field of transportation logistics. In this work, we tackle very-large scale problem instances with time windows. Among other techniques, metaheuristics are frequently used to solve large-scale instances close to optimality. We present an island-model genetic algorithm variant and apply several techniques such as offspring selection and adaptive constraint relaxation. To validate our approach, we perform test runs on benchmark instances with 1000 customers and compare the results to the currently best-known solutions. Â© 2011 IEEE.},
