 abstract = {Model building is a fundamental task in simulation-based optimization. In this paper we demonstrate the application of Sim# in combination with HeuristicLab to optimize set-up times of arbitrary machinery. On top of Sim#, custom simulation extensions have been implemented and are used to create a simulation model of real world machinery. These extensions enable the design of simulation components that can be reused within different simulation models. This allows to easily create multiple model implementations that reflect different designs of a machine by using a combination of already existing and adapted components. The resulting model is used as evaluation function for the optimization inside HeuristicLab.},
